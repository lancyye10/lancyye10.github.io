        <h2 class="intro">About the moon</h2>
        
        <p>The moon is very different from Earth, it has no wind, weather or life, and is boiling hot by day and freezing at night. There are <em>lots</em> of saucer shaped holes called <strong>craters</strong>.</p>

        <h2 class="goodfacts">Interesting facts</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li> The moon does not give off it's own light. It is visible from Earth because it shares the Sun's light.
            <li> The Moon takes about 27.3 days to spin around once, and around the Earth too. That's why we see only one side of the Moon.
            <li> People visited the Moon six times already.
            </ul>

        <h2 class="eclipse">Lunar Eclipse</h2>
        <p>Sometimes when we look at the night sky, the Moon was visible now, but then it gets smaller and smaller and it sometimes becomes red! That is called a <strong> lunar eclipse</strong>. When there is a total lunar eclipse, the Earth's shadow, with the Sun's light, falls on the Moon so that it looked like it's red. This is called a <strong>blood moon</strong>.</p>
        <h3 class="eclipse">About</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Only very less people on Earth could see a lunar eclipse once.
            <li> Sometimes you see a total lunar eclipse, other times you only see a part of the eclipse.
            <li> A blood moon is visible in a total lunar eclipse.
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Moon visit</h2>
        
        <p>The Moon is fun to visit. You could jump <em>much</em> higher there, and there's way less gravity. You could collect moon rocks there, too. Be careful with the craters!</p>
